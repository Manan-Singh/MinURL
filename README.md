# MinURL
An small MERN stack app that shortens URLs. If you want to try to use this projcect locally then you should first create a config.js file. It should look something like:

## Config.js
``` javascript
module.exports.MONGO_CONNECTION = "<YOUR CONNECTION INFORMATION FOR MONGOOSE GOES HERE>";
```

After that all you have to do is npm install and npm start. 

This was a pretty simple project but I thought it would be fun to mess around with React. It was. I have a samle demo running here: https://frozen-mountain-33886.herokuapp.com#/?_k=hkfv7q and yes, I see the irony of having a URL shortener having such a long URL. I don't feel like paying money for a domain so oh well.
